# Theory from Einstein
  I was asked what followed after the formula, it is in Lambda.
  Back in the MIT there was no ML or AI. 2020 is when I gained my PhD.

# Here it is
  E=(((m^2+e^2)+(p^2+c^2)+c^(2))/(t)+((A+F)+((log10(A+D)2)))

# Conclusion
  Everyone in my life has taught me something so far, 33 years of study, so could not have been done it alone
  with everyone support.
  I am autist. The theory I assume should be used for good.
  Thanks to everyone. Especially my family.
